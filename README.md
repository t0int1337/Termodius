# Termodius
A mod for Termius that adds a few features that I think are missing.

## Features
- Custom CSS Themes
- Devtools

## Installation
1. Download the [index.js](https://github.com/t0int1337/Termodius/) file.
2. Open libtermius folder:
   - Termius: `%localappdata%\Programs\Termius\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\@termius\libtermius`
   - Termius Beta: `%localappdata%\Programs\Termius Beta\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\@termius\libtermius`
3. Replace the index.js file with the downloaded file.
4. Restart Termius. (You may need to kill the process in Task Manager)
